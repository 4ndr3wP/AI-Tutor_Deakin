Distinction Task 10.2: Literature Review and Summarisation

## Overview

You are now aware of some sub-fields in RL (like MARL, MORL and others). There exist several others. Choose a specific survey paper (from the ones listed below), and summarise the literature in that field. When summarising, avoid simply presenting disconnected summaries of different sub-topics in isolation. Instead, explore and describe how the subtopics within the survey paper may be related to each other, how one may have had an influence on the other, etc., Present your summaries in illustrative and creative ways (using your original figures/illustrations). Feel free to add your original video or other links to supplement the summaries if needed. Some fields you may choose to cover are:
